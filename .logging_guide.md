üîπ General Logging Style Guide
Keep it structured ‚Üí [Component] - [Action/Issue] - [Details]
Use active voice ‚Üí "Failed to load" instead of "Loading was failed"
Be specific ‚Üí "Invalid input format" instead of "Something went wrong"
Provide solutions if possible

üîπ Logging Messages by Level
‚úÖ INFO (General process updates)
[DataLoader] - Successfully loaded dataset from %s
[Preprocessing] - Text tokenization completed. %d samples processed.
[Training] - Model training started with batch size %d and learning rate %.5f
[Evaluation] - Accuracy achieved: %.2f%% on validation set
[Inference] - Prediction completed in %.3f seconds.
[Pipeline] - Process completed successfully with no errors detected.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (Unexpected behavior, but execution continues)
[Preprocessing] - Found %d missing values, filling with default.
[Model] - Using CPU instead of GPU due to compatibility issues.
[Training] - Convergence warning: Loss has not decreased for %d epochs.
[Evaluation] - Low performance detected: Accuracy dropped below expected threshold.
[System] - High memory usage detected, consider optimizing model size.

‚ùå ERROR (Something failed, but the system continues)
[DataLoader] - Failed to read file: %s. Please check the file path.
[Preprocessing] - Tokenization error: %s. Invalid input detected.
[Training] - Model checkpoint not found: %s. Training cannot resume.
[Inference] - Unable to process request due to missing input parameters.
[API] - Response failed with status code %d: %s

üö® CRITICAL (Fatal errors, system failure, must stop execution)
[System] - GPU is unavailable, terminating process.
[Training] - Detected NaN values in gradients, stopping training to prevent corruption.
[Security] - Unauthorized access attempt detected, shutting down service.
[Model] - Weight corruption detected, aborting model initialization.
[Database] - Connection lost. Unable to recover.
